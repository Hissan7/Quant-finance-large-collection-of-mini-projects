BlackScholes.py --
Implements the Black-Scholes model for pricing European call and put options analytically.

BlackScholesMonteCarlo.py --
Uses Monte Carlo simulations to estimate European option prices based on the Black-Scholes framework.

CAPM.py --
Implements the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) to estimate expected returns of an asset based on market risk.

CouponBond.py --
Calculates the price and yield of coupon-paying bonds (bonds paying periodic interest).

GBM.py --
Simulates Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM), often used to model stock price dynamics.

MarkowitzModel.py --
Implements Markowitz Portfolio Theory to find optimal portfolio allocations minimizing risk for a given return.

NormalReturns.py --
Analyzes stock returns under normal distribution assumptions, often calculating mean, variance, and probabilities.

OrnsteinUhlenbeckProcess.py --
Simulates the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, commonly used for modeling mean-reverting assets like interest rates.

PresentValue.py --
Computes the present value of future cash flows discounted at a given interest rate.

RandomWalk.py --
Simulates random walks, often used as a simple model for stock price behavior.

VaR.py --
Calculates Value at Risk (VaR) using analytical methods (e.g., variance-covariance approach).

VaRMonteCarlo.py --
Computes Value at Risk using Monte Carlo simulations for more complex portfolios.

VasicekModel.py --
Implements the Vasicek interest rate model, a mean-reverting stochastic process for interest rate modeling.

WienerProcess.py --
Simulates Wiener processes (Brownian motion), which are building blocks for stochastic finance models.

ZeroCouponBond.py --
Calculates pricing and yield for zero-coupon bonds, which pay no periodic interest but are sold at a discount.
